# 🎧 Music Recommendation Chatbot

This project implements a music recommendation system powered by a chatbot interface. The chatbot is trained to understand user preferences and suggest music accordingly. The web interface is built using **Django**, and the chatbot model is trained using **Keras** with **NLTK** for natural language preprocessing.
